# Recipe Pi

I hated bringing my laptop and phone into the kitchen to look at recipes while cooking. My housemate and I designed a recipe hub to store and display all of our favorite recipes on a wall-mounted monitor. The app displays step-by-step directions for the recipes, with the ingredient list being the first page. The app is controlled by a number pad keyboard.
